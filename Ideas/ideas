Key in the todos here and track in git.

1. Some very basic state machine model
2. NBA season mode only. No extra online mode / fantasy mode.

After some "brainstorming" (which was random thinking before falling asleep lol), I decide to make this game possession based. Some basic rules are described below:
1. In each possession, the ten players on the court are analyzed first.
2. Players' decision are decided based on statistics and some random generator.
3. Energy system should be considered, but I still haven't find a very nice model for that.
4. Anyway, let's get started first.

Let's identify what are the outputs from a possession
1. How long does it take. Output the possession seconds. For gameplay reason, the possession will always be accurate to 0.1s instead of nba (only last minute to 0.1s)
2. Outcome. Did the team score? Let's list down the possibilities:
    (1) Hit a field goal:
        (1.1) two points
            (1.1.1) two points with a free throw
        (1.2) three points
            (1.2.1) three points with a free throw
    (2) foul
        (2.1) technical foul (a very specific case, need to discuss later)
        (2.2) lead to free throw
            (2.2.1) two
            (2.2.2) three
        (2.3) keep possession
            (2.3.1) time change to a specific time (14s maybe)
            (2.3.2) continue the 24s
        (2.4) change possession
    (3) Miss a field goal
-------------------------------------------------
So ultimately, in each possession we should return:
1. Who keeps the possession after this possession?
2. What is the remaining time for this possession?
3. Did anyone score?
4. Any other changes in the stats?
